# Evaluation

This repository contains the implementation of various Python scripts including pyramid printing, bubble sort algorithm, perfect number identification, and finding the saddle points of a matrix.

## Files

- `pyramid.py`: This script contains the logic for generating pyramids with a specified number of levels.
- `bubble_sort.py`: This script implements the bubble sort algorithm.
- `perfect_numbers.py`: This script contains a function to identify perfect numbers.
- `saddle_points.py`: This script contains a function to find the saddle points of a matrix.

## Usage

To use these scripts, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can run the scripts using the following command:

```bash
python <script_name>.py
```

You can also import the functions in these scripts into your own Python scripts like this:

```python
from <script_name> import <function_name>
```

Then you can call the function with the appropriate parameters:

```python
<function_name>(<parameters>)
```
